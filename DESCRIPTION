Description: QTExpTool provides an alternative way of evaluating 
    differential gene expression.
    This tool uses the gene expression data generated from any standard
    gene expression pipeline and returns whether a gene is over-expressed
    or under-expressed on a five point likert-type scale. The goal for this
    representation is to make the gene expression more clinically relevant
    to physicians and other non-bioinformatics specialists that are only
    interested in the qualitative judgement of changes in gene expression.
